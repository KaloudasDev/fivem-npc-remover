## üéÆ GTA NPC & Vehicle Cleanup

**GTA NPC & Vehicle Cleanup** is a lightweight, efficient client-side script for GTA V that automatically removes unwanted NPCs, random cops, garbage trucks, and vehicles. Designed to enhance gameplay experience by reducing clutter, improving server performance, and providing a cleaner, more immersive environment for players.

This script continuously controls game density multipliers and cleans the nearby area of vehicles, ensuring a smooth, optimized session for players and server admins.

## ‚ú® Features

* [x] Disables random cops and NPC spawns to reduce distractions.
* [x] Removes garbage trucks and random boats from the environment.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Disable Spawns:**  
   The script disables random NPCs, cops, garbage trucks, and boats via native GTA V functions every frame.

2. **Density Control:**  
   All density multipliers for vehicles, peds, and scenarios are set to zero each tick, preventing new entities from spawning.

3. **Clear Vehicles:**  
   Vehicles in a 1000-unit radius around the player are cleared continuously to maintain an empty environment.

4. **Area Cleanup:**  
   Removes vehicle generators in a 1000x1000x1000 area centered on the player, further ensuring no new vehicles spawn.
